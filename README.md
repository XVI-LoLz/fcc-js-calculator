## Try it
You can check the live version [here](https://xvi-lolz.github.io/fcc-js-calculator/)


## Notes
There are a few quirks with this calculator.
The most important is that it calculates using **immediate excecution logic**, which means the _operations will be calculated following the input order_ not the operation hierarchy you see in most calculators.

This is a project for the freeCodeCamp Frontend certification. If you want to learn Web Development you can go to [freeCodeCamp](https://xvi-lolz.github.io/fcc-js-calculator/)!
